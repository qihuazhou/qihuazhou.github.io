He aims at developing highly efficient AI/ML systems that empower ubiquitous intelligent services, particularly in cloud-edge environments, to enrich human life in diverse aspects.

His research interests lie at the intersection of **Edge Intelligence**, **Nueral Multimedia Streaming**, **Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML)**, and **Distributed Processing**. 
He recognize the importance of optimizing the \textit{entire life-cycle} of intelligent tasks, from data sensing to knowledge-aware analytics and cross-client interaction. 
Embracing this closed-loop design philosophy, his vision is to extend the boundary of modern learning paradigms and present new research prospects for enhancing system-level performance.

His research outcomes cover a broad spectrum, ranging from \textit{theory} to \textit{implementation}, with a primary focus on three key aspects.
