### About
---

Dr. Qihua Zhou is an Assistant Professor ("Hundred Talents Program") with the [College of Computer Science and Software Engineering](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/pages/user/index?id=1309) at [Shenzhen University](https://www.szu.edu.cn/). He is a co-founder of [Hong Kong DrBody Co., Limited](https://zerodrbody.wixsite.com/drbody).

He received his Ph.D. degree in the Department of Computing, [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), advised by [Prof. Song Guo](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/songguo) (now HKUST).
Before that, he received a Ph.D. degree in the College of Automation and College of Artificial Intelligence, [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.njupt.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Yanfei Sun](https://yjs.njupt.edu.cn/dsgl/nocontrol/college/dsfcxq.htm?dsJbxxId=9B9D05C52D3F2DCFE050007F01006EFE). 
<!-- and [Prof. Kun Wang](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/60/2f/c31133a352303/page.htm). -->

He aims at developing edge-native AI/ML systems that empower ubiquitous intelligent services, particularly in resource-constrained environments, to enrich human life in diverse aspects.

### Research Statement
---

His research interests lie at the intersection of **Edge AI Systems**, **Efficient MoE/LLM Serving**, **Diffusion Generative Models**, **Tiny/On-Device Machine Learning**, **Neural Video Codecs**, and **Distributed Processing**.  

He recognize the importance of optimizing the *completed life-cycle* of intelligent tasks, from data sensing to knowledge-aware analytics and cross-entity interaction. 
Embracing this closed-loop design philosophy, his vision is to extend the boundary of modern learning paradigms and present new research prospects for enhancing system-level performance.

<!-- His research outcomes cover a broad spectrum, ranging from *theory* to *implementation*, with a primary focus on three key aspects. -->

We are looking for strongly motivated Master/PhD students, Research Assistants/Associates, and Postdoctoral Fellows. Undergraduate interns and visiting students (onsite/remote) are also welcome! If you are SZU students, I will respond to all your emails (100% guaranteed) and you can also come to my office (Room 618-1) to talk with me.

Please fill out this [Online Form](https://wj.qq.com/s2/17904116/3f89/) and drop me an email if you are interested. 


###### **For Undergraduate Interns/Visiting Students:**  
---

You are always welcome! You will have the opportunity to get top-tier resources and work on pioneering projects, especially those in AI and LLM. We will help you explore the latest advancements and push the boundaries of what's possible. 

We are happy to recommended outstanding students to top technology companies or overseas prestigious universities for further studies.


###### **For Master/PhD Applicants:**  
---

Please take a look at my research statement and come up with a research problem that you want to work on in the [Online Form](https://wj.qq.com/s2/17904116/3f89/). It is recommended that you read these documents ([CV Writing Tips](https://www.discoverphds.com/advice/applying/cv-for-phd-application), [SZU Master Admission](https://yz.szu.edu.cn/info/1006/12985.htm), [SZU PhD Admission](https://yz.szu.edu.cn/info/1011/12703.htm)) before sending emails.


It is **not** recommended to reach out to me if:
* you have no prior experiences on debugging projects with over 500 lines of codes – you will suffer a lot if you do not have this experience.

* you have no passion in research at all but just want a postgraduate degree. You are welcome to consider RA positions first (see below).



**For Postdoc/RA Applicants:**
---

We always have Postdoc/RA openings on different kinds of projects, especially those collaborated with national/Guangdong key laboratories and leading technology companies in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area. You will get paid competitively.
