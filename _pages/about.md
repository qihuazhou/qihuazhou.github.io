### About
---

Dr. Qihua Zhou is an Assistant Professor in the [College of Computer Science and Software Engineering](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/pages/university/index) at [Shenzhen University](https://www.szu.edu.cn/). He is also a co-founder of [Hong Kong DrBody Corporation Limited](https://zerodrbody.wixsite.com/drbody).

He received his Ph.D. degree in the Department of Computing, [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/web/en/home/index.html), advised by [Prof. Song Guo](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/songguo).
Before that, he received a Ph.D. degree in the College of Automation and College of Artificial Intelligence, [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.njupt.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Yanfei Sun](https://yjs.njupt.edu.cn/dsgl/nocontrol/college/dsfcxq.htm?dsJbxxId=9B9D05C52D3F2DCFE050007F01006EFE) and [Prof. Kun Wang](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/60/2f/c31133a352303/page.htm).

He aims at developing edge-native AI/ML systems that empower ubiquitous intelligent services, particularly in resource-constrained environments, to enrich human life in diverse aspects.

### Research Interests
---

His research interests lie at the intersection of **Edge Artificial Intelligence**, **Neural Multimedia Streaming**, **Tiny Machine Learning**, and **Distributed Machine Learning**. 
He recognize the importance of optimizing the *completed life-cycle* of intelligent tasks, from data sensing to knowledge-aware analytics and cross-entity interaction. 
Embracing this closed-loop design philosophy, his vision is to extend the boundary of modern learning paradigms and present new research prospects for enhancing system-level performance.

<!-- His research outcomes cover a broad spectrum, ranging from *theory* to *implementation*, with a primary focus on three key aspects. -->
