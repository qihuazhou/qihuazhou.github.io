### About
---

Qihua Zhou is a Distinguished Professor with the [College of Computer Science and Software Engineering](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/pages/user/index?id=1309) at [Shenzhen University](https://www.szu.edu.cn/). He is a co-founder of [Hong Kong DrBody Co., Limited](https://zerodrbody.wixsite.com/drbody). He works closely with [Prof. Laizhong Cui](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/staff/cuilz/eng/index.html) at SZU and [Prof. Song Guo]((https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/songguo)) at HKUST.

He received his Ph.D. degree in the Department of Computing, [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), advised by [Prof. Song Guo](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/songguo) (now HKUST).
Before that, he received a Ph.D. degree in the College of Automation and College of Artificial Intelligence, [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.njupt.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Yanfei Sun](https://yjs.njupt.edu.cn/dsgl/nocontrol/college/dsfcxq.htm?dsJbxxId=9B9D05C52D3F2DCFE050007F01006EFE). 
<!-- and [Prof. Kun Wang](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/60/2f/c31133a352303/page.htm). -->

He aims at developing edge-native AI/ML systems that empower ubiquitous intelligent services, particularly in resource-constrained environments, to enrich human life in diverse aspects.

<!-- He is a co-founder of [Hong Kong DrBody Corporation Limited](https://zerodrbody.wixsite.com/drbody). -->

### Research Statement
---

He focus on the design, optimization and deployment of highly-efficient **Embodied/Edge AI Systems**, covering the research intersection of **Efficient MoE/LLM Serving**, **Diffusion Generative and VLA Models**, **Tiny/On-Device Machine Learning**, **Neural Video Codecs**, and **AI for Health**.  

He recognize the importance of optimizing the *completed life-cycle* of intelligent tasks, from data sensing to knowledge-aware analytics and cross-entity interaction. 
Embracing this closed-loop design philosophy, his vision is to extend the boundary of modern learning paradigms and present new research prospects for enhancing system-level performance.

<!-- His research outcomes cover a broad spectrum, ranging from *theory* to *implementation*, with a primary focus on three key aspects. -->
