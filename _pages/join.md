### Join Us
--- -->

We are looking for strongly motivated Master/PhD students, Research Assistants/Associates, and Postdoctoral Fellows. Undergraduate interns and visiting students (onsite/remote) are also welcome! 

If you are SZU students, I will respond to all your emails (100% guaranteed) and you can also come to my office (Room 618-1) to talk with me.

Please fill out this [<u>Online Form</u>](https://wj.qq.com/s2/17904116/3f89/)  and drop me an email if you are interested.

### **For Undergraduate Interns/Visitors:**   

---

You are always welcome! You will have the opportunity to get top-tier resources and work on pioneering projects, especially those in AIGC, LLMs, and robots. 

This program is designed for undergraduate students who aspire to academic/research training and can dedicate a sustained period of at least six months to focused study. Primary mentorship opportunities are usually reserved for current or incoming SZU students, but if you are truly exceptional (and we have exceptional cases), you can still get my mentoring. Research stipends are provided. 

I often spend much time with undergraduate students who exhibit a genuine passion for research, offering in-depth interactions and creating opportunities for their future development. We are happy to recommend outstanding students to top (overseas) universities.

### **For Master/PhD Applicants:**   

---

This program is designed for those who are highly self-motivated and aim to publish papers in top-tier venues of AI and systems, e.g., ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, MobiCom, ASPLOS, and EuroSys [click (here](https://csrankings.org/#/fromyear/2020/toyear/2025/index?all&cn) to learn more about computer science rankings). Our research group has a strong track record of conducting cutting-edge research and constantly strives for high research impact. 

We encourage interested students to take a look at the research statement and come up with a research problem that you want to work on. Make sure you read these documents ([CV Writing Tips](https://www.discoverphds.com/advice/applying/cv-for-phd-application), [SZU Master Admission](https://yz.szu.edu.cn/info/1006/12985.htm), [SZU PhD Admission](https://yz.szu.edu.cn/info/1011/12703.htm)) before sending emails.

It is ***not*** recommended to reach me if:  
- you have no prior experience in debugging projects with over 500 lines of code – you will suffer a lot if you do not have this experience.  
- you have no passion for research at all but just want a postgraduate degree. You are welcome to consider RA positions first. (see below).

### **For Postdoc/RA Applicants:**   

---

We always have Postdoc/RA openings on different kinds of projects, especially those collaborated with national/Guangdong key laboratories and leading technology companies in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area. 

You are supposed to be qualified to contribute to our research/engineering projects, so you need to show your ability. Please note that it's a job and you should hold at least a bachelor's degree. The contract is usually for six months, and we can extend it if you perform well. You will get paid competitively.
